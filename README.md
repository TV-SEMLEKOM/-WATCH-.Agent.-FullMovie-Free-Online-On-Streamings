Watch Agent full movie recommend legal methods. You can purchase the film on official online stores or streaming websites. Watching a movie is always a good idea, especially if it is good. Agent is one of those movies you do not want to miss out on.

Agent has entered the MCU after an agonizing wait, with opportunities to watch and stream the anticipated movie finally becoming available. The MCU's only cinematic release of 2024 has received an immense level of hype as Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman finally come together for their iconic team-up as the titular heroes. They are joined by a whose-who of Marvel movie characters whose careers span decades, including several returning X-Men characters such as Tyler Mane's Sabretooth, Aaron Stanford's Pyro, and Jason Flemyng's Azazel.

Agent is Shawn Levy's first shot at directing a Agent movie, although he has worked with Ryan Reynolds in the past in Free Guy and The Adam Project. His comedy credentials make him a good fit for the famously irreverent Agent franchise, which continues the iconic brand of R-rated humor established in Agent and Agent 2, though this time takes things into the MCU timeline. Marvel has been keeping its cards close to its chest when it comes to Agent details, which is a sentiment that extends to its expected release schedule.

Agent Releases In Theaters On July 26, 2024

Available In Several Premium Formats, The exclusive theatrical release of Agent begins on July 26, 2024. It is the MCU's first R-rated movie, which means that anyone under the age of 17 is required to be accompanied by an adult if watching Agent in theaters. This rating is largely due to the no-holds-barred violence that typifies Agent's cinematic career, but strong language and sexual references are also to be expected.

The movie has a runtime of 2 hours and 7 minutes and features one post-credits scene. This makes it the longest Agent movie to date, with Agent coming in at 1 hour 48 minutes and Agent 2 hitting 1 hour and 59 minutes. Agent is available to watch in IMAX, 4DX, and other premium formats, which promise to deliver the full impact of seeing the heroes engaging in the MCU's most brutal fight sequences.

Agent Cast:

Agent was written by Ryan Reynolds, Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, Zeb Wells, and Shawn Levy. It was directed by Shawn Levy and stars the following actors: Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson/Agent Hugh Jackman as Logan/Wolverine Emma Corrin as Cassandra Nova Morena Baccarin as Vanessa Rob Delaney as Peter Leslie Uggams as Blind Al Karan Soni as Dopinder Matthew Macfadyen as Mr. Paradox

Agent Streaming Release Date?

Agent will eventually be released on Disney+, rather than Netflix or Max, as the movie is produced and distributed by Disney. Disney has yet to announce a streaming release date for Agent. The three latest MCU movies to hit streaming — The Marvels, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania — all came to Disney+ 89 days after their theatrical debuts. Should the distributor follow suit here, Agent would come to Disney+ on October 23.

Is 'Agent' in Theaters?

Yes, Agent will be a big-screen adventure well-suited for two of Marvel's most beloved characters. The hugely anticipated team-up won't have to tangle with too much competition that weekend, though the disaster film sequel Twisters did storm into theaters a week earlier. The week after Agent, the film will then be sharing theater space with M. Night Shyamalan's new thriller Trap, Colman Domingo's Oscar hopeful Sing Sing, and Zachary Levi's children's book adaptation Harold and the Purple Crayon.

Watch the Trailer for 'Agent'?

The release of Agent may be just around the corner, but Marvel dropped one more special look at the upcoming film just a week before the big premiere day. Apart from a quick reference to Spider-Man at the end, the final trailer is a big departure from the previous trailers by focusing much more on the emotional core of both Agent and Wolverine. However, that's not why this trailer has gotten people talking. Not only does it give us a proper look at Lady Agent (who is rumored to be played by Ryan Reynolds' real-life wife Blake Lively), but the trailer confirms that Dafne Keen will indeed be reprising her role as Logan's surrogate daughter, X-23, last seen in the film Logan.

When Will Agent Release On Streaming?

Agent Will Stream On Disney Plus. There is no official word on when Agent will be available to stream. As it is officially part of the MCU, it will almost certainly be exclusively available on Disney Plus later this year, which currently houses the vast majority of MCU productions and the movies that were once part of Fox's X-Men franchise. The biggest likelihood is that Agent will be available on Disney's streamer around this year's holiday season, since this is typically peak time for streaming as audiences keep indoors.

Agent has generated an incredible level of hype, and will likely remain in theaters for as long as possible as it sticks the landing with critics. This is even more possible given that it will be the only MCU movie of 2024, leaving the road wide open until Captain America: Brave New World releases on February 14, 2025. With that in mind, Marvel Studios will likely want to capitalize on the box office revenue of Agent for as long as possible, possibly even relishing in the latest billion-dollar MCU movie.

When Will Agent Release On Digital , DVD & BLU-Ray?

Before Agent is available to stream with a subscription to Disney Plus, it will be available to buy/rent and download digitally via VOD services likely at a price between $15 - $20. Again, Marvel Studios has yet to confirm a date when Agent will release digitally on home media, though it will probably be around Fall 2024, and September at the earliest. This format should come with behind-the-scenes featurettes and other extra features like gag reels, though the full details of what it will contain has to be confirmed.

As of November 25, 2024, Agent is available on HBO Max. Only those with a subscription to the service can watch the movie. Because the film is distributed by 20th Century Studios, it’s one of the last films of the year to head to HBO Max due to a streaming deal in lieu of Disney acquiring 20th Century Studios, as Variety reports.

Agent movie could eventually be available to watch on HBO Max, though it will likely be a paid digital release rather than being included with an HBO Max subscription.
